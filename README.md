## 🛠️ Installation / Local Preview

If you’re just using the static version:

1. Clone or download this repository.  
2. Open index.html in any modern browser.  
   - No build step required; it works over file:// directly.  

For a more advanced setup (future):  
- Host on Vercel / Netlify by connecting this repo — it auto-deploys the static page.  

## 📩 Waitlist Form

The “Join the Waitlist” form is hooked to Formspree.  
- Submissions go to the verified email in the Formspree dashboard.  
- You can view all signups under *Submissions* on Formspree.  
- To change the recipient, update the Formspree form settings.

## 📦 Deployment

Recommended quick deploy:
- *Vercel*: Connect the GitHub repo and click deploy.  
- *Netlify*: Import the repo and deploy; you’ll get a shareable .netlify.app URL.

## 🧪 Usage

- Share the live link with students/teachers.  
- Collect emails via waitlist.  
- Use the AI chat mockup as a prototype; integrate a backend LLM later for real summaries & Q&A.  
- Enable “Buddy Talks” with a lightweight real-time layer (e.g., WebRTC or chat rooms) in future iterations.

## 👥 Contributing

1. Fork the repo.  
2. Make changes (e.g., split components, add real backend).  
3. Submit a pull request with a clear description.

## 💡 Future Ideas

- Real-time “Buddy Talks” with voice/text (WebRTC).  
- Backend for PPT upload, parsing, and LLM summarization (OpenAI or similar).  
- Authentication (student/teacher roles).  
- College-specific onboarding & verification (e.g., CVM University integration).
